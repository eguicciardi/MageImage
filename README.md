# MageImage
A quick and dirty image checker for Magento products.

This script is very simple but yet very effective. Just configure it with the attribute id of the images you can have in a standard Magento products and it will tell you if they have any image associated with then.

No more, no less.

Just put the script in the root folder and run it from whereever you want.
